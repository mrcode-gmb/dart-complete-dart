# Complete Dart Learning Exercises by MrCode

This project contains practice code, chapter tasks, and assignments for learning Dart with MrCode.
It is designed for learners who want to run small examples, understand syntax, and complete exercises step by step.

## Reference Book

This project follows the Dart learning path from the book:
- `dart-apprentice-1nbsped-1950325326-9781950325320_compress.pdf`

Use the book together with the files in `bin/` to practice each chapter and assignment.

## Learning Goal

Use this repository to:
- Learn Dart basics through chapter files.
- Practice assignment/challenge tasks.
- Run and test code in your own local environment.

## Project Structure

- `bin/hello_dart_project.dart`: Basic intro script.
- `bin/chapter2.dart`: Boolean logic and simple control flow.
- `bin/assigment1.dart`: Assignment practice for variables, math, and logic.
- `bin/chapter3.dart`: Strings, loops, enums, and more.
- `bin/chapter3Assigment.dart`: Chapter 3 assignment tasks.
- `bin/chapter3Challenge.dart`: Chapter 3 challenge tasks.
- `bin/chapter5.dart`: Functions, optional parameters, named parameters.
- `lib/hello_dart_project.dart`: Small library example.
- `test/hello_dart_project_test.dart`: Unit test example.

## Prerequisites

- Dart SDK `3.7.0` or newer

Check your Dart version:

```bash
dart --version
```

## Setup on Your Environment

1. Clone the project:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd hello_dart_project
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
dart pub get
```

## Run Exercises

Run any chapter or assignment file with:

```bash
dart run <file-path>
```

Examples:

```bash
dart run bin/hello_dart_project.dart
dart run bin/chapter2.dart
dart run bin/assigment1.dart
dart run bin/chapter3.dart
dart run bin/chapter3Assigment.dart
dart run bin/chapter3Challenge.dart
dart run bin/chapter5.dart
```

## Run Tests

```bash
dart test
```

## Recommended Learning Order

1. `bin/hello_dart_project.dart`
2. `bin/chapter2.dart`
3. `bin/assigment1.dart`
4. `bin/chapter3.dart`
5. `bin/chapter3Assigment.dart`
6. `bin/chapter3Challenge.dart`
7. `bin/chapter5.dart`

## Notes

- This is a learning repository, so some files are intentionally simple and practice-focused.
- Edit the chapter files, rerun them, and compare outputs as you learn.
- Use the reference PDF as your main lesson guide and this repo as your hands-on practice workspace.
